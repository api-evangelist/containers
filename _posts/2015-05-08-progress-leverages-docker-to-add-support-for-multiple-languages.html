<p>Looking to extend the appeal of its platform-as-as-service (PaaS) environment, Progress this week announced it is using Docker container APIs to add support for additional programming languages to its Modulus PaaS service.Originally designed specifically for Node.js on top of an implementation of a MongoDB database, Paul Nashawaty, director of product marketing and solutions for Progress, says Docker makes it now feasible for Java, PHP, and Python developers to make use of a Modular PaaS environment that is distributed across multiple cloud services managed by Amazon, Joyent, and Digital Ocean.The benefit of that approach, says Nashawaty, is that Modulus essentially delivers DevOps as a service by enabling distributed computing applications to automatically scale and invoke services such as load balancing whenever necessary using a set of templates developed by Modulus.The Modulus PaaS environment itself, says Nashawaty, is based on Linux containers that are exposed to developers as a series of consumable â€œservos.</p>
