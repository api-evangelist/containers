<p>Creating a simple IronWorker worker can be quick and easy.But if you’ve used IronWorker to build a  complex worker , you may have found the experience a bit cumbersome.  
 The reason is that sometimes you just don’t know if your worker will run the same way it does when you run it locally, due to the local environment or perhaps missing dependencies.  
 If you have to do a lot of debugging, this can waste a lot of time and cause some serious pain.Thats it.</p>
