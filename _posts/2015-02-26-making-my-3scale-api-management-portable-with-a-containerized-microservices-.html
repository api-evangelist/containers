<p>26 Feb 2015   
As I work to find balance in this new micro-service, container driven world of APIs, 3Scale is continuing to be an essential layer to the business of my API / micro service orchestration.In alignment with what I’ve been preaching for the last 5 years, Im needing to re-define my valuable API infrastructure resources to be as agile, flexible, and portable as I prescribe in the public stories that I tell.Using 3Scale I have the service composition for my platform pretty well defined.The problem is, this definition is not as portable, and flexible as it could be, for the next shift in my API operations, via Docker, allowing me to manage loosely coupled stacks of micro-services.Within this new approach to API operations, I need every single Docker container I orchestrate to ping home, and understand where in my business service composition it exists and operates.</p>
