<p>Docker has been flying high for over 20 months.It’s totally evident that Docker was on its ways to becoming the existing standard for container technology, the steaming thing in cloud computing in 2014.Then along came CoreOS which was one of the leading backers of Docker until Dec 1, 2014 when it dropped a bomb or we could say a rocket and announced a competitive container virtualization technology called Rocket.Is Docker losing its way?CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi stated that Docker is losing sight of its goal of making sure that its core container technology lives up to its promise.</p>
