<p>In the past year alone, the Docker community has created 100,000+ images and over 300+ million images have been pulled from Docker Hub to date. Over 20 million of these pulls came from the 70+ Official Images that Docker develops in conjunction with upstream partners, like Oracle, CentOS, and NGINX.NGINX is used by over 40% of the world’s busiest websites and is an open-source reverse proxy server, load balancer, HTTP cache, and web server. The official image on Docker Hub has been pulled over 3.4 million times and is maintained by the NGINX team.</p>
