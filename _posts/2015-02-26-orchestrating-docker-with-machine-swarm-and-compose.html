<p>Back in December, we announced our new tools for orchestrating distributed apps: Machine, Swarm, and Compose.Today the first versions of these tools are available to download.They’re not ready for production yet, but we’d really like for you to try them out and tell us what you think.Machine takes you from “zero-to-Docker” with a single command.It lets you easily deploy Docker Engines on your computer, on cloud providers, and in your own data center.</p>
