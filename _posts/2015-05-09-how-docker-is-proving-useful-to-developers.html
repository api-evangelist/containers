<p>Versatile app distribution platform Docker offers a way for developers and sysadmins to build, ship and run distributed applications.Despite its uses, some developers are still unsure about its functions and its day-to-day applications.After building his own understanding of the platform, Romin Irani published a post outlining some of the uses he has found to help other developers spot opportunities.Firstly, it is important to remember that Docker acts as a standard shipping container for applications.Using abstraction, the platform creates a standard container in which to run the app, irrespective of what tools were used to build it.</p>
