<p>With the impending release of Puppet Enterprise 3.8, we will be adding support for managing Docker and Docker containers.For those of you who havent yet had the chance to take a look at Docker,  it enables apps to be quickly assembled from multiple components and eliminates some of the friction between development, QA, and production environments.With new Docker Platform tools Swarm, Machine and Compose, it is a growing component of modern infrastructure.Docker was first released around two years ago, and since then its increasingly used as the basis for testing infrastructure, development environments and all manner of production applications.</p>
