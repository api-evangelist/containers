<p>Today we’re excited to announce that Docker Compose is available for download.Docker Compose is an orchestration tool that makes spinning up multi-container applications effortless.Head to the install docs to download it.With Compose, you define your application’s components – their containers, their configuration, links, volumes, and so on – in a single file, then you can spin everything up with a single command that does everything that needs to be done to get your application running.If you’ve used Fig before, this will sound familiar – in fact, Compose is based directly on the Fig codebase and is backwards-compatible with Fig applications.</p>
