<p>Joyent today announced the launch of Triton, its new container infrastructure for making Docker deployments in on-premise clouds and on its own cloud architecture easier.This announcement comes about half a year after the company raised $15 million with the stated goal of releasing exactly this kind of service (after previously raising $120 million).Joyent argues that while Docker brings lots of new efficiencies to the development and deployment process, it also introduces new complexities, because you have to manage multiple containers and hosts, and wrangle with networking implementations and security issues.Overall, Triton is made up of a number of components which include some of Joyent’s existing offerings.There are the Docker containers at the center of the service, which are managed by the Triton Docker Engine and run on top of Joyent’s Triton Container Hypervisor.</p>
