<p>Ever since its inception and public preview almost 7 years ago at PDC 2008, Microsoft Azure has provided a means to detect health of virtual machines running on the platform and to perform auto-recovery of those virtual machines should they ever fail.This process of auto-recovery is referred to as “Service Healing”, as it is a means of “healing” your service instances.  We believe service healing, a.k.a auto-recovery, is an integral part of running business critical workloads in the cloud and hence this auto-recovery mechanism is enabled and available on virtual machines across all the different VM sizes and offerings, across all Azure regions and datacenters.</p>
