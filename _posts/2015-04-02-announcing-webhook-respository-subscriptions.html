<p>Back in December at DockerCon Europe, we announced chained Webhooks.This enabled you to configure your deployment processes to continue only if the previous Webhook completed successfully.Â 
Today we are excited to announce expanded Webhook capabilities.You can now set up Webhook subscriptions to repositories that you do not own but use.For example, when your favorite Official Repository is updated with a security patch you can automate your build and deploy processes to take advance of changes immediately.</p>
