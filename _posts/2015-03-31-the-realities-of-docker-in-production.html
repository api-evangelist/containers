<p>Docker seems like a fundamentally better abstraction for packaging and deploying applications in a persistent way across multiple environments.Among individual developers and ops engineers its praised, but at a recent Docker in Production meetup held at Heavybit, engineers from Iron.io, ClusterHQ, RelateIQ and Docker discussed the realities of running Docker in Production -- namely what does and doesnt work.Dockerâ€™s roots are in the development world, where developers tend to run applications on a single machine.But the truth is that real apps run on more than one computer.</p>
