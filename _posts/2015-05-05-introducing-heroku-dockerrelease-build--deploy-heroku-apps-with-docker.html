<p>When Heroku launched the Cedar container stack 4 years ago, we became one of the first companies to use Linux Containers (LXC) to create a secure, performant and scalable cloud platform.Heroku has been a leader in the containerization movement, and we’ve spent years hardening, honing and evolving our runtime container stack.This means that developers can 
git push
 apps written in their favorite language and Heroku will build containers that are deployed to a production-quality environment.With this approach, developers are set free from managing operating systems, package updates, server infrastructure and their inevitably complex interactions.Containers are essential to making this model work, as they create firm abstractions and boundaries between an application’s code and all the dependent pieces necessary to make them run.</p>
