<p>At its core, Scalingo is about running Docker containers.Each of these containers has to be monitored in order to get meaningful data for our users and for us as a provider.At the APIDays Berlin and APIStrat Europe 2015 event, I gave a talk about the different APIs which can be used to monitor	containers on a server.It deals with Docker	Stats API limits and how to access data from the Linux control groups and namespaces created by Docker and the Acadock open source project which is the result of my investigations on the subject..</p>
