<p>If hybrid clouds are the future, as both researchers and cloud creatorsÂ are hinting, then IBM is smart to push its hybrid cloud plan into action.The companys plan, unveiled Monday, can be summed up in one word: Docker.Er, make that three: Docker, Bluemix, and OpenStack.With Enterprise Containers, IBM hints that this is meant to be more than a reskin of Docker or a repackaging with Bluemix and OpenStack.Enterprise Containers allows workloads to be packaged in Docker-based containers, deployed either locally or remotely on IBMs cloud, and outfitted with IBMs security and management tools.</p>
