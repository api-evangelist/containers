<p>If you didn’t already know, Kitematic is the fastest and the easiest way to use Docker on your Mac  We are super excited to announce Kitematic is going to be part of Docker family. We get to work alongside the team of developers that inspired us to start a company together. Together we will continue our mission to build easy-to-use yet powerful open source developer products at Docker.So why did we join Docker?The answer to that question can be found in the Kitematic story.</p>
