<p>Another day in tech, another company tops $100 million in money raised.Docker, a fast-moving maker of software for managing applications on a global basis, said Tuesday that it has raised another $95 million.With this fourth round of funding Docker, which two years ago was near extinction, has raised about $160 million.The company declined to discuss its valuation, but it is likely worth more than $1 billion, up from $400 million last September, according to a source who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.But Dockerâ€™s chief executive downplayed the importance of the new money.</p>
