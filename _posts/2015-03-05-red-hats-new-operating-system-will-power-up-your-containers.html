<p>Open-source software giant Red Hat said on Thursday that its new operating system custom made to power Linux containers is now available to download.Red Hat has been a big proponent of Docker and its container packing technology going back as far as last summer touting its support of the startup and making sure its Enterprise Linux 7 product was compatible with Docker’s technology.Container technology has generated a lot of buzz over the past year by promising a type of virtualization that’s lighter weight than your typical virtual machine.In order for a container to actually run, it needs to be connected to a host Linux OS that can distribute the necessary system resources to that container.While you could use a typical Linux-based OS to power up your containers, as CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi (whose own startup offers a competing container-focussed OS) told me last summer, these kinds of operating systems merely get the job done and don’t take full advantage of what containers have to offer.</p>
