<p>In a recent post, The New Minimalist Operating Systems, I briefly described three new OSs designed with Docker in mind. I also mentioned Boot2Docker, which I considered to be the smallest (23MB) Docker-focused OS at the time. Less than two weeks later, a new tiny Docker OS has arrived: RancherOS. If you are interested in what makes these two very minimal OSs tick, read on.What do we get in the tiny ISO images released by these two projects?</p>
