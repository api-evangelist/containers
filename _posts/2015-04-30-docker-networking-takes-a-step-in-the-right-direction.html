<p>It’s been just over one month since the SocketPlane team joined Docker and we’ve been working hard to deliver on our promise of helping to grow a healthy ecosystem around Networking.This week, with the help of our partners, we’ve taken the first major step by making libnetwork open source.What is libnetwork?In it’s initial form libnetwork is an amalgamation of the networking code from both libcontainer and Docker Engine that we expect to grow into a multi-platform library for networking containers, much like how libcontainer is used to create containers today.Libnetwork also introduces the Container Network Model (CNM) which was inspired by this GitHub issue and the valuable input from networking partners Cisco, IBM, Joyent, Microsoft, Rancher, VMware and Weave.</p>
