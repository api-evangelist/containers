<p>Yesterday Heroku released beta support to build and deploy Heroku apps with Docker.It would be an understatement to say that this created quite a bit of buzz inside Appirio.We are big fans of Docker and have been promoting it for all types of uses, blogging about it and using it for our topcoder challenges.With so many developers on the topcoder platform (750,000+), Docker mitigates environment issues involved with launching challenges, evaluating submissions and putting code into production.Since Heroku has their own LXC container technology, we didn’t expect them to adopt Docker this soon… if at all.</p>
