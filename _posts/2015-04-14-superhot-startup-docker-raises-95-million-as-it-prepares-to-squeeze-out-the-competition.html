<p>Just over two years ago, a company called Docker came out of nowhere with a ton of hype and lofty ambitions.As of today, Docker is valued at $1 billion, reports Bloomberg.Docker basically invented an entire market for its signature container technology, and it only wants to grow and grow until theres no room for anybody else.To that end, Docker on Tuesday announced a $95 million round of Series D funding from Insight Venture Partners, reportedly valuing the company just above the $1 billion mark it needs for entrance to the ranks of the so-called unicorn startups.Â 
This brings Dockers total funding up to $150 million as it furthers its campaign of expansion against upstart competitors like CoreOS, which took its own much smaller $12 million round of funding from Google Ventures earlier this month.</p>
