<p>Linux container company Docker this week said it would acquire SDN start-up SocketPlane, a developer of a native networking stack for Docker software.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.SocketPlane was founded last fall by former Cisco, Red Hat, HP, OpenDaylight and Dell officials.The company is looking to bring enterprise-grade networking to the Docker ecosystem by developing software designed to address the performance, availability and scale requirements of networking in large, container-based cloud deployments.The SocketPlane software employs a DevOps model and tools to enable scale, programmable agility, and policy-driven automation, and provides network virtualization to mask network configuration complexity.</p>
