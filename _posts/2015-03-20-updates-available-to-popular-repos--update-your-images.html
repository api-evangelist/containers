<p>At Docker, we’re working with our open source community to build a rich ecosystem of containerized images. In the past year alone, Docker users and partners have created 100,000+ images and pulled 200+ million images from Docker Hub. We’re proud of our progress to-date, and committed to the developers who rely on Docker images for critical workflows—whether they’re Official Repos released by Docker ourselves, or images created by the community.Before Official Repos, it was members of the community like @Pilwon who got the public repositories going with content for their fellow users.We would like to thank @Pilwon for being an awesome and early creator of community images, which he posted in an account called ‘dockerfile’.</p>
