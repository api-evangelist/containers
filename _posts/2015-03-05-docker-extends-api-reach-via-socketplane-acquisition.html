<p>Arguably one of the primary reasons that Docker containers are so widely adopted is that Docker stabilizes the API; thereby giving developers access to any number of micro-services that can be invoked on multiple platforms.Now Docker is preparing to extend those APIs across networks following the acquisition this week of SocketPlane.David Messina, vice president of marketing for Docker, says that while Docker has enjoyed tremendous developer support, the next big thing for the container APIs will be the addition of software-defined network services that will make it simpler to build distributed computing applications.Messina says this is an area that SocketPlane has been working on, which will soon manifest itself in a future update to the Docker API.Once those services are in place it should be possible to, for example, build distributed applications that span hybrid clouds, says Messina.</p>
