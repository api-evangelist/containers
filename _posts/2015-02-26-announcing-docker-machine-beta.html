<p>At DockerCon EU earlier this year, we announced Docker Machine, a tool that makes it really easy to go from “zero to Docker”.Machine creates Docker Engines on your computer, on cloud providers, and/or in your data center, and then configures the Docker client to securely talk to them.It works a bit like this:
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev [info] Downloading boot2docker.[info] Creating SSH key.[info] Creating VirtualBox VM.</p>
