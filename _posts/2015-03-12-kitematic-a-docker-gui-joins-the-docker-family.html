<p>We are thrilled to announce the acquisition of Kitematic, the fastest and easiest way to use Docker on the Mac. Because Docker is a tool for developers, we find that the developers in the ecosystem build the best tools for Docker. Orchard’s Fig (now Compose) and SocketPlane are great examples of where great ideas were generated in the ecosystem to improving the developer experience and providing operational flexibility for distributed applications.Today with Kitematic, we take another step in simplifying the developer experience and making Docker accessible to new and different software developers – further growing and enriching the community and ecosystem together.Kitematic completely automates the Docker installation and setup process and provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for running Docker containers on the Mac.</p>
