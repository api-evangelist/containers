<p>We are extremely excited to announce the first beta release of Swarm, a native clustering tool for Docker.For the past two years, Docker has made the lives of millions of developers easier by making building, shipping and running applications simpler through containers.However, things get complicated when dealing with more than one host for Docker containers in a distributed environment.Â 
This is where Swarm comes in.Swarm pools together several Docker Engines and exposes them as a single virtual Docker Engine.</p>
