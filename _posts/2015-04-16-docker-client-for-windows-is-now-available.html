<p>Today, at Microsoft and Docker, Inc.we are making the Docker command line interface available on Windows starting with the Docker 1.6 release.As a part of our partnership, Microsoft has worked with the Docker community to port the Docker client to Windows, making it easy to manage Docker hosts and containers for those using Windows as their development machines.Docker Client for Windows can be used to manage Docker hosts running Linux containers today, and managing Windows Server Containers and Hyper-V Containers will be supported in the future to provide the same standard Docker Client and interface on multiple development environments.</p>
