<p>Docker containers have rapidly been gaining adoption based on the positive developer experience, ease of deployment and the portability of the images.Docker containers are easy to build, move and deploy locally, on traditional systems and in a growing number of Cloud Providers.Many companies are looking at Docker as a means to quickly develop their cloud centric applications or micro-services.Cloud Providers provide a fast environment on which to iterate on these applications.In scenarios where these Containers represent a micro-service, or component of a broader application deployment, we want to tie Docker Deployments into a broader workflow manager.</p>
