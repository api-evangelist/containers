<p>The guest blog post below was written by Jaehyun Wie while he was a developer intern on the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Team.It shows you how to run your Docker apps locally using the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (CLI).The Elastic Beanstalk command line interface (EB CLI) makes it easier for developers, working with command line tools, to get started with Elastic Beanstalk.Last November, we released a revamped version of the EB CLI that added a number of new commands and made it even simpler to get started.Today, weâ€™ve added new commands to run your app locally.</p>
