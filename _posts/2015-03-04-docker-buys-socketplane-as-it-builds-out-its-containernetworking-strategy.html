<p>You can add another acquisition to Docker’s plate with the startup set to announce on Wednesday that it has bought a small networking startup called SocketPlane.The acquisition, whose financial terms were not disclosed, is just one more step in Docker’s plans to become the de-facto container-management company whose technology can play well on multiple infrastructures.SocketPlane’s entire six-person staff is joining Docker and will be helping the container-centric startup develop a networking API that makes it possible to string together hundreds to thousands of containers together no matter if the containers “reside in different data centers,” explained Scott Johnston, Docker’s SVP of product.The upcoming networking API can be thought of as an extension to Docker’s recently announced orchestration services.Although the new orchestration services makes it possible to spin up and manage multiple clusters of containers, the current Docker networking technology built into the platform only works well for “a handful of hosts and containers” as opposed to the thousands needed in complex environments like Spotify’s infrastructure, explained Johnston.</p>
