<p>We’re excited to release Flocker 0.4. Flocker 0.4 is a big step forward towards production management of data volumes because it includes a lot of foundation work needed to offer an API for managing data volumes. We’ve also added support for CentOS 7 and a couple of often requested features: restart policies and configurable volume size.</p>
