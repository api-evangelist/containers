<p>Docker’s suite of orchestration services that the container-management startup first detailed in December are now available in beta for the public to download, Docker said on Thursday.These new orchestration services are just another step for Docker to tout its cloud-agnostic platform, geared for enterprise customers worried about vendor lock-in.Judging by Microsoft’s participation in the announcement, it looks like Microsoft is trying to make itself appealing to those same customers as well.While this announcement is not too surprising given that the company has made it clear that its eyeing orchestration services as a way to further develop the Docker platform, what’s interesting is how excited Microsoft seems to be.This follows through with Microsoft’s pledge of support to making sure Docker will be fully integrated with its Azure cloud and Windows Server.</p>
