<p>There’s a reason Docker just raised a $95M funding round.The promise of containers running asynchronously in the cloud means the opportunity for greater developer productivity and agility.But the problem here isn’t containerizing services, it’s ensuring that all of these distributed and asynchronous workloads are working together as a single organism.Iron.io believes that DockerWorker is the key to a better workflow.</p>
