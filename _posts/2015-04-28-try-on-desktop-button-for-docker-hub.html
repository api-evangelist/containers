<p>We’re excited to announce a new feature on Docker Hub (for Mac users right now) – a button that pulls, configures and runs Docker containers for you on your desktop in a single click.We do this by using an external protocol handler that talks to Kitematic, a desktop GUI app for Docker.This is the first step of connecting Kitematic to the Docker Hub!Here’s how it works:
Clicking on the button will first prompt you to download Kitematic, if you don’t have the latest version installed.Download and install Kitematic, click on the “Try on Desktop” button again.</p>
