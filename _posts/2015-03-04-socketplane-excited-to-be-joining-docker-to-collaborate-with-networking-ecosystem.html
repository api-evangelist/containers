<p>At Socketplane we started out as four guys with a collectively strong belief in open source and open communities. We aligned around a shared vision that we wanted to be a critical part of Docker’s once in a decade disruption.Now that we are part of the Docker team, we couldn’t be happier.We never looked to hedge our bets, our success was and obviously still is tied to the success of Docker.While there are many reasons that we decided to join the team, first and foremost Docker is unlike any other projects we have worked on in the past; the focus on user experience and simplicity is unmatched.</p>
