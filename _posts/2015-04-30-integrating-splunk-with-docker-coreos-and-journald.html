<p>Hal here, your friendly Lorax and developer evangelist!I wanted to share with everyone a guest post from a Splunker whom I met and see regularly at the Metro Atlanta Splunk User Group, Robert Labrie.Robert is a DevOps Engineer at The Network Inc, a company which builds solutions that prevent, detect and remediate misconduct to help companies maintain ethical cultures.This post is about how Robert approached building out a new architecture, and of course, how to index the data generated by all of the components.Without further ado, take it away, Robert!</p>
