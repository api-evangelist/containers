<p>This morning, we announced a $95M Series D funding round that will help ensure that Docker can deliver on an ambitious set of long term priorities.More importantly, we believe that it will enable us to deliver on product, support, and community enablement in a manner worthy of our incredible ecosystem and the sea change that the open Docker platform is bringing to how distributed applications are built, shipped, and run.WHY A NEW ROUND, WHY NOW?Since Docker just closed a large [Series C] round in September of 2014, it is inevitable that a lot of public discussion will focus on timing, the amount raised, or the valuation of this round.While the value being created by the broader Docker ecosystem is ultimately more important than the valuation of this round, Iâ€™d like to share some of the rationale for raising a large round now.</p>
